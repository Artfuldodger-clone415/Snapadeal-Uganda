PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================
Snapadeal is a comprehensive deals and discounts platform for Uganda, similar to 
Groupon. It connects customers with local businesses offering discounted deals on

- Payments: Flutterwave integration for Mobile Money
- Authentication: Role-based access control (Customer/Merchant/Admin)
- Notifications: Real-time notification system
- File Upload: Multi-image upload with validation

   - Create/update handlers in handlers/ directory
   - Add routes in main.go
   - Update database migrations if needed
   - Add proper error handling and validation

2. Frontend Development:
   - Create components in components/ directory
   - Add pages in pages/ directory
   - Update services in services/ directory
   - Add routing in App.tsx
   - Implement responsive design

3. Testing:
   - Test API endpoints using tools like Postman
   - Test UI functionality in browser

   - Test file upload functionality
   - Verify notification system

4. Documentation:
   - Update this documentation file
   - Add code comments for complex logic
   - Update API documentation
   - Document new environment variables

Code Structure Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all React components
- Follow REST API conventions for backend
- Implement proper error handling everywhere
- Use React Context for state management
- Follow Go best practices and conventions
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Add proper validation for all inputs
- Use proper HTTP status codes
- Implement proper logging

Git Workflow
- Create feature branches for new development
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Test thoroughly before merging
- Keep main branch stable and deployable
- Use pull requests for code review

DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================

Production Setup Requirements
- Use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite for better performance
- Configure proper JWT secrets (long, random strings)
- Set up SSL certificates for HTTPS
- Configure production Flutterwave keys
- Set up email service (SMTP configuration)
- Configure cloud file storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary, etc.)
- Set up domain names and DNS
- Configure reverse proxy (Nginx)
- Set up monitoring and logging
- Configure backup procedures

Environment Variables for Production
- DATABASE_URL: PostgreSQL connection string
- JWT_SECRET: Strong, unique secret key (minimum 32 characters)
- FLUTTERWAVE_PUBLIC_KEY: Production public key
- FLUTTERWAVE_SECRET_KEY: Production secret key
- SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASS: Email configuration
- FRONTEND_URL: Production frontend URL for CORS
- UPLOAD_DIR: Production file storage directory
- REDIS_URL: Redis connection for caching (optional)

Scaling Considerations
- Database indexing for better query performance
- API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- CDN for static assets and images
- Load balancing for multiple server instances
- Caching layer (Redis) for frequently accessed data
- Database connection pooling
- Horizontal scaling with container orchestration
- Image optimization and compression
- Database query optimization

Security Considerations
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention (GORM handles this)
- XSS protection in frontend
- CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- Secure password hashing (bcrypt)
- JWT token expiration and refresh
- HTTPS enforcement
- Environment variable security
- File upload security (type, size validation)
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Proper CORS configuration

TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

Common Issues and Solutions

1. Port Conflicts
   Problem: "Port already in use" errors
   Solution: Check if ports 3000, 3001, 3002, 8080 are available
   Commands: 
   - lsof -i :3000 (check port usage)
   - kill -9 <PID> (kill process using port)

2. Database Connection Issues
   Problem: "Failed to connect to database"
   Solution: 
   - Ensure SQLite file has proper permissions
   - Check if backend directory is writable
   - Verify DATABASE_URL format for PostgreSQL
   - Check if uploads directory exists

3. CORS Errors
   Problem: "CORS policy" errors in browser console
   Solution: 
   - Verify REACT_APP_API_URL in frontend .env files
   - Check backend CORS configuration in main.go
   - Ensure backend is running before frontend

4. Authentication Issues
   Problem: "Invalid token" or "Unauthorized" errors
   Solution:

   - Test all major features manually
   - Create test accounts for all user types

2. Code Understanding (Days 2-3)
   - Study the backend models and API structure
   - Understand the React component hierarchy
   - Review authentication and authorization flow
   - Examine the database schema and relationships
   - Test notification system and file uploads

3. Feature Development (Week 1+)
   - Pick a feature from the TODO list
   - Start with smaller features like email notifications
   - Follow the development workflow outlined above
   - Test thoroughly before implementation
   - Update documentation for new features

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
================================================================================

The Snapadeal platform follows a modern three-tier architecture:

1. Presentation Layer (Frontend)
   - Three separate React applications for different user types
   - Responsive design with mobile-first approach
   - Real-time notifications and file upload capabilities
   - Context-based state management

2. Application Layer (Backend API)
   - RESTful API built with Go and Gin framework
   - JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
   - File upload handling with validation
   - Real-time notification system
   - Payment integration with simulation support

3. Data Layer (Database)
   - SQLite for development (easy setup)
   - PostgreSQL support for production
   - Proper relationships and constraints
   - Automatic migrations and seeding

Key Design Patterns:
- Repository pattern for data access
- Middleware pattern for authentication
- Context pattern for React state management
- Service layer pattern for API calls
- Component composition for UI reusability

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the Snapadeal project. 
The codebase is well-structured, fully functional, and ready for continued 
development. All core features are implemented and working, with a solid 
foundation for scaling and adding new features.

The system has been thoroughly tested and includes:
- Complete user authentication and authorization
- Full deal management workflow with image support
- Payment processing with simulation capabilities
- Real-time notification system
- Comprehensive admin and merchant dashboards
- Customer purchase flow with transaction tracking
